## Set up

This project uses `badaas-cli` to generate the files that allow us to run this example. For installing it, use:

```bash
go install github.com/ditrit/badaas-cli
```

Then generate files to make this project work with `cockroach` as database:

```bash
badaas-cli gen docker
```

For more information about `badaas-cli` refer to [badaas-cli Docs](https://github.com/ditrit/badaas-cli/README.md).

Finally, you can run the api with:

```bash
make badaas_run
```

The api will be available at <http://localhost:8000>.

httpie util will be used in the examples below, but it works with curl or any similar tools.

## Authentication

Currently we only support a basic authentication using an email and a password.
The default credentials for the user are Ì€`admin-no-reply@badaas.com` and `admin`.

```bash
http POST localhost:8000/login email=admin-no-reply@badaas.com password=admin
```

## Custom route

Let's check the route this example adds:

```bash
http localhost:8000/hello
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 13
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 04 May 2023 09:32:29 GMT

"hello world"
```
