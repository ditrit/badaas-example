## Set up

This project uses `badctl` to generate the files that allow us to run this example. For installing it, use:

```bash
go install github.com/ditrit/badaas/tools/badctl
```

Then generate files to make this project work with `cockroach` as database:

```bash
badctl gen --db_provider cockroachdb
```

For more information about `badctl` refer to [badctl Docs](https://github.com/ditrit/badaas/tools/badctl/README.md).

Finally, you can run the api with:

```bash
make badaas_run
```

The api will be available at <http://localhost:8000>.

## Authentication

Currently we only support a basic authentication using an email and a password.
The default credentials for the user are Ì€`admin-no-reply@badaas.com` and `admin`.

## Test it

httpie util will be used in the examples below, but it works with curl or any similar tools.

### Custom routes

Let's first start by checking the route this example adds:

```bash
http localhost:8000/hello
```

```json
"hello world"
```

### CRUD routes

Get all the sales:

```bash
http localhost:8000/objects/sale
```

```json
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2023-05-10T08:32:11.754637Z",
        "DeletedAt": null,
        "ID": "a9ca9271-8e5e-4774-ab45-7f8ee6328d87",
        "Product": null,
        "ProductID": "64f3331e-77df-403c-a548-5c66df6f0e81",
        "Seller": null,
        "SellerID": "60f87294-6d78-4da8-b1a9-ec5418900ce5",
        "UpdatedAt": "2023-05-10T08:32:11.754637Z"
    },
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2023-05-10T08:32:11.769282Z",
        "DeletedAt": null,
        "ID": "deabdeda-3730-4399-b99f-3268fabdd591",
        "Product": null,
        "ProductID": "19708413-f245-41a0-b9ec-6154c35e2e0a",
        "Seller": null,
        "SellerID": "28086169-269d-493a-9121-69b78b777a27",
        "UpdatedAt": "2023-05-10T08:32:11.769282Z"
    }
]
```

Get all the sales done by a seller (adapt the id according to the response you obtained in last step):

```bash
http GET localhost:8000/objects/sale seller_id=29b027c0-184a-42a7-950e-a5c9b9d6b6e2
```

```json
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2023-05-10T08:32:11.754637Z",
        "DeletedAt": null,
        "ID": "a9ca9271-8e5e-4774-ab45-7f8ee6328d87",
        "Product": null,
        "ProductID": "64f3331e-77df-403c-a548-5c66df6f0e81",
        "Seller": null,
        "SellerID": "60f87294-6d78-4da8-b1a9-ec5418900ce5",
        "UpdatedAt": "2023-05-10T08:32:11.754637Z"
    }
]
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
http GET localhost:8000/objects/sale seller:='{"id":"29b027c0-184a-42a7-950e-a5c9b9d6b6e2"}'
```

We can also query the attributes of the related objects:

```bash
http GET localhost:8000/objects/sale seller:='{"name":"franco"}'
```

And so on:

```bash
http GET localhost:8000/objects/sale seller:='{"company":{"name":"ditrit"}}'
```
